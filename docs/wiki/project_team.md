# Project & Team

## Sure, but what does this do?

The project is an __all-in-one integrated__ system for monitoring the environment of terrariums and other kinds of bioactive enclosures. Through the use of sensors contained in the enclosure and connected to a terminal, environmental measurements are conveyed to a __web-based user interface__ which communicates both raw and processed data and analytics. This will enable users to stay informed about the conditions of their terrarium remotely.

Furthermore, the system will _notify_ the user in the event of an __emergency__ where environmental conditions fall outside of desired limits. These can either be user-defined or based on a specific preset. The system is designed to be easily expandable and customizable to fit the needs of the user.

## Requirements and Specifications

### (Initial) List of Sensors

The team has considered the following sensors (as per the initial scope of the project):

1. __Grove - Light Sensor v1.2__ ([link](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Light_Sensor/)),
2. __Grove - Loudness Sensor__ ([link](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Loudness_Sensor)),
3. __Grove - Multi Color Flash LED__ (5mm) [link](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Multi-Color-Flash-LED-5mm.html),
4. __Grove - Temperature & Humidity Sensor__ ([link](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor)),
5. __Grove - Moisture Sensor__ ([link](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Moisture_Sensor)),
6. __Grove - Vibration Sensor__ (SW-420) [link](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Vibration_Sensor_SW-420/);
   - __Breadboard/Hub Grove__ (for the connection between the above-mentioned sensors; similar to [link](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_Hub/)).

### (Initial) List of Requirements

1. The system shall be able to measure the __light intensity__ in the enclosure.
2. The system shall be able to measure the __loudness / sound intensity__ in the enclosure.
3. The system shall be able to measure the __temperature__ in the enclosure.
   1. The system shall be able to support __different temperature scales__ (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
4. The system shall be able to measure the __humidity__ in the enclosure.
5. The system shall be capable of detecting levels of __vibrations__ in the enclosure.
6. The system shall be able to detect the __moisture__ levels within the enclosure.
7. The system shall be able to detect whether all the parameters obtained from the sensors are within the __desired ranges__.

#### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able use software to monitor the environmental conditions of my terrarium, such that I can stay informed about these conditions when I am busy and not present in the same physical space.
2. As a user, I want to be able to set the desired ranges for the environmental conditions, such that the system can notify me in the event of an emergency.
3. As a user, I want to be able to understand the interface intuitively, such that I can use the system without any prior knowledge and without the need for extensive documentation.
4. As a user, I want to see analytics on the measurements recorded in my terrarium, such that I can observe long-term patters, see the bigger picture and ultimately make more informed decisions.
   
## Team Contract

The following section contains an excerpt from the **Team Contract**.

### Meetings

1. **Meetings:** 2 weekly (_~2.5_ hours each), on campus; the schedule’s final form (for the week) posted to the communication platform – Monday morning
2. **Structure:** `SCRUM` principles, continuous work on the project’s development, analysis of potential risks and additional discussions
3. **External tool** – solidification of the schedule for the upcoming week: possible online meeting(s) – if desired by the majority

### Communication platform

- Principle platform – `Discord` ![Discord Logo](.placeholder/path)

### Management

1. __PM:__ Michal. Re-election will take place on _April 21st_
2. __Decisions:__ majority vote; subject to a same-day appeal process followed by a final revote
3. Principle project management platform – ![ClickUp logo](.placeholder/path)

### Motivation and ambition

- As a group, we all agree to aim for a GRADE 5

### Solving conflicts and disagreements

1. Decisions will be made by __majority vote__:
on the day they are made, decisions are subject to appeal by team members – trigger of a discussion for reconsideration → final revote
2. Mediation of meetings – Project Manager (+ team members’ feedback)
3. Conflicts handled __internally__; teacher’s involvement – last-resort given the matter is irreconcilable
