## Project's name

The project is entitled _"Terminarium"_, a portmanteau derived from the words __Terrarium__ and __Terminal__ that represents the interplay between the physical components of our integrated system; environmental data is collected from within a terrarium physical sensors that are connected to a terminal.

## Purpose of the project

The project is an __all-in-one integrated__ system for monitoring the environment of terrariums and other kinds of bioactive enclosures. Through the use of sensors contained in the enclosure and connected to a terminal, environmental measurements are conveyed to a __web-based user interface__ which communicates both raw and processed data and analytics. This will enable users to stay informed about the conditions of their terrarium remotely.

Furthermore, the system will _notify_ the user in the event of an __emergency__ where environmental conditions fall outside of desired limits. These can either be user-defined or based on a specific preset. The system is designed to be easily expandable and customizable to fit the needs of the user.

## Intended usage

TODO: write 1 short paragraph explaining the intended usage (e.g., user persona, examples of scenarios, etc.).

Jerry, new tarant, preset, modify ...

User is an avid keeper of exotic pets and has brought home a new tarantula

## Initial System design

The __initial system's design__ is depicted in the following diagram (with an additional legend):
